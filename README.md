# Fritz's Box

An MP3 player for Kids, based on an Arduino and a DFPlayer Mini

## Code

The code is written for Arduino and runs on a Pro Mini clone.
Get the Arduino IDE at https://www.arduino.cc.

## Schematics

I layed out the scematics using the amaizing [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org). If you want to have a look grab a copy and open the `.fzz` file.

I've made some adjustments to the final product, because not all the parts were available in Fritzing. See the parts list for more details.

## Enclosure
